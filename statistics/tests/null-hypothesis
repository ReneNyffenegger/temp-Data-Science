First statistical hypothesis testing
------------------------------------
   Null hyptohesis: are male and female birhts equally likely?
   
   Tested in the 1700s by John arbuthnot (and later by Pierre-Simon Laplace):
   1629 - 1710: In all of the 82 years, more males born in London than females.
   With valid null hypothesis, the likelyhood for this outcome 0.5^82 (= p-value)
   
Confidence interval
-------------------
   Confidence intervals are closely related to statistical significance testing.
   For example, if for some estimated parameter θ one wants to test the null
   hypothesis that θ = 0 against the alternative that θ ≠ 0, then this test can be
   performed by determining whether the confidence interval for θ contains 0.
