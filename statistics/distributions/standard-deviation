SD, Ïƒ

The standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to
its mean and is calculated as the square root of the variance. 

A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (aka expected value).

A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.

SD is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions
    -> standard error
    
In finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset     


Relationship to standard error
------------------------------
  Standard error = standard deviation devided by the square root of the sample size
