mean:                (or expected value) the weighted average of the possible values (probabilities are weights)
median:              ....
variance:            second moment of the pmf or pdf about the mean. Measure of a distribution's dispersion.
skewness:            a measure of the extent to which a pmf or pdf leans to one side of its mean. The third standardized moment of the distribution.

                        Positive skew: "longer" tail extends to positive direction. Apparently, in normal like distributions, positive
                        skews are found more often than negative skews

kurtosis:            a measure of the fatness of the tails of a pmf or pdf. The fourth standardized moment of the distribution
                        
                         Kurtosis measures how fat or thin the tails of a
                         distribution are relative to a normal distribution. 

                            leptokurtic: Distributions with long tails
                            platykurtic: Distributions with short tails 

                            Normal distributions have zero kurtosis.
                            
standard deviation:  square root of the variance - another measure of dispersion. 
mode:               (discrete random variable): value with highest probability
support:             the smalles closed set whose complement has probability zero.
head:                range of values where pmf or pdf is relatively high
tail:                the complement of the head within the support, the large set of tvalues where the pmf or pdf is relatively low.
