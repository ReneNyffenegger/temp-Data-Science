SD and SE appear to be very similar .. they are quite similar, but are used differently.

SE = SD / sqrt(n)  
   standard error is equal to the standard deviation
   divided by the square root of the sample size, n.
   -> The larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error.
                   


The standard deviation is a measure of the variability of the sample.
The standard error is a measure of the variability of the sampling distribution.
 
Just as the standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of values in the sample,
the standard error is a measure of the dispersion of values in the sampling distribution.
  That is, of the dispersion of means of samples if a large number of different
  samples had been drawn from the population.
