The standard error is measures the accuracy with which a sample represents a population.

A sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error.

Relationship to standard deviation
----------------------------------
  Standard error = standard deviation devided by the square root of the sample size
  --> The more data points involved in the calculations of the mean,
      the smaller the standard error tends to be.
