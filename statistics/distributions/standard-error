The standard error is measures the accuracy with which a sample represents a population.

A sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error.

The SE is always an estimator of a population characteristic; it is not a descriptive statistic -
it is an inferential statistic.

The SE is an estimate of the interval into which a population parameter will probably fall.
The SE also enables the investigator to choose the probability that the parameter will
fall within the estimated interval, usually called the "confidence interval."


Relationship to standard deviation
----------------------------------
  Standard error = standard deviation devided by the square root of the sample size
  --> The more data points involved in the calculations of the mean,
      the smaller the standard error tends to be.

Feinstein noted:
  A standard error has nothing to do with
  standards, with errors, or with the communication
  of scientific data. The concept is an
  abstract idea, spawned by the imaginary
  world of statistical inference and pertinent
  only when certain operations of that imaginary world
  are met in scientific reality

Glanz
  Most medical investigators summarize their
  data with the standard error because it is
  always smaller than the standard deviation.
  It makes their data look better [...]
  data should never be summarized with the standard
  error of the mean.


Example
-------

Here is a statement containing the SE:
  The mean of the sample was 73 mg/dL, with an SE of the mean of
  3 mg/dL.
  
  This implies that the mean of the population from which the sample
  was randomly taken will fall, with 95% probability, in the interval of
  73 Â± (1.96 x 3), which is from 67.12 to 78.88.
