The standard error is measures the accuracy with which a sample represents a population.

A sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error.

Relationship to standard deviation
----------------------------------
  Standard error = standard deviation devided by the square root of the sample size
  --> The more data points involved in the calculations of the mean,
      the smaller the standard error tends to be.

Feinstein noted:
  A standard error has nothing to do with
  standards, with errors, or with the communication
  of scientific data. The concept is an
  abstract idea, spawned by the imaginary
  world of statistical inference and pertinent
  only when certain operations of that imaginary world
  are met in scientific reality
