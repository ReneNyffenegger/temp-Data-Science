dispersion, aka variability, scatter, spread

The extent to which a distirbution is stretched or squeezed.

Statistical measures of dispersion with the same unit as the quantity measured are:
  - variance
  - standard deviation
  - interquartile range
  - range
  - mean asbolute difference (aka Gini mean absolute difference)
  - median absolute deviation (MAD)
  - Average absolute deviation (or simply "average deviation")
  - Distance standard deviation

Some dimensionless measures of the dispersion are
  - Coefficient of variation
  - quartile coefficient of dispersion
  - relative mean difference (equal to twice the Gini coefficient)
  - entropy
