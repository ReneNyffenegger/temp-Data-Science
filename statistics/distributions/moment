0th moment             : total probablity == 1
1st moment             : mean
2nd central moment     : variance                  called central because its "about the mean", not about 0.
3rd standardized moment: skewness
4th standardized moment: kurtosis

For a probability on a bounded interval, the collection of all the moments (of all orders, from 0 to âˆž)
uniquely determines the distribution (Hausdorff moment problem).
The same is not true on unbounded intervals (Hamburger moment problem).

In probability theory and statistics, a standardized moment
of a probability distribution is a moment (normally a higher
degree central moment) that is normalized.
