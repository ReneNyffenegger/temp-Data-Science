The Central Limit Theorem:  The basis of much of statistical inference and how we get those 95% confidence intervals. 

When an infinite number of successive random samples are taken from a population,
the sampling distribution of the means of those samples will become approximately
normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ/√ N as the
sample size (N) becomes larger, irrespective of the shape of the population distribution.
--> This is why rolling the dice n times for m repetitions the plot of the sum
    of the n repetiosn becomes bell shaped (normal).


 A second generalization from the central limit theorem is that as n
 increases, the variability of sample means decreases.
