Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)

Aka
   Pearson's r, 
   Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) 
   
The PCC is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y.

The PCC is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. 

The form of the definition involves a "product moment", that is, the mean (the first moment about the origin)
of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier product-moment in the name. 

According to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the PCC has a value between +1 and −1,
where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation,
and −1 is total negative linear correlation.
