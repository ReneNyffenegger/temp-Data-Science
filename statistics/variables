Variable:
  - property of an event (such as a championship) or object (such as a person)
  
Independent vs dependent variables.
  Generally:
    the independent variable is manipulated by an experimenter and
    the effect on the dependen variable is meassured
    
    
Levels of independent variabl
   for example
      - experimental and control group (2 levels)
      - comparing 5 products has 5 levels.
   levels = number of experimental conditions.
   
Qualitiative (categorical) vs quantitative variables.
  - qualitative (aka categorical)
       - No natural sense of ordering
       - no addition/subtraction
            -> nominal scale
            
            
Levels of measurement
  - Nominal scale
      - labels
      - no addtion/subtraction
      - no natural sense of ordering.
  - Ordinal scale
       - ordered, but no (sense of) distance
           (for example: very poor, poor, average, good, very good)
  - Interval scale
       - numeric scale with sense of distance
       - Unlike ratio scale, interval scales don't have zero point (multiplication not allowd)
       example: temparature(???) ( 30 deg C is not 2 * 15 deg C)
  - Ratio scale
       - numeric scale
       - has z zero point (--> multiplication is allowed)
       example: weight (person of 80 kg weighs twice that of person of 40 kg)
