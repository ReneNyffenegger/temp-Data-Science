Distribution:
  P(d) = log10(d+1) - log10(d) = log10( (d+1) / d) = log10 (1 + 1/d)

 This distribution is found if log(x) is uniformly and randomly distributed. 
 
 
 Moments of random variables for first digits following Benford's law:
    - mean:      3.440
    - variance:  6.057
    - slewmess:  0.806
    - kurtosis: -0.548

Moments of random variables for first and second digits following Benford's law:
    - mean:       38.590
    - variance:  621.832
    - slewmess:    0.772
    - kurtosis:   -0.547

 
 Additive fluctuations do not lead to Benford's law, they lead to normal probability distributions.
 Mulitplicative fluctations to lead to Benford's law.
 
 Distributions where Benford's law is expected and unexpected
    exptected
       - mean is greater than the median and the skew is positive
       - Numbers that result from mathematical combination of numbers: e.g. quantity Ã— price
       - Transaction level data: e.g. disbursements, sales
       - Numbers produced when doing any multiplicative calculations with an
         Oughtred slide rule, since the answers naturally fall into the right logarithmic distribution.
         
    not expected
       - sequentially assigned numbers (invocie numbers...)
       - Numbers influenced by human (psychological) thought ($1.99)
       - Numbers with minimum and/or maximum
       - No transaction recorded
 
 Detecting fraud:
   In 1972, Hal Varn suggested that the law could be used to detect possible fraud
   in lists of socio-economic data submitted in support of public planning decisions.
  (People who fabricate figures tend to distribute their digits fairly uniformly,)
   Mark Nigrini showed that Benford's Law could be used in forensic accounting and auditing
   as an indicator of accounting and expenses fraud

 Special observations:
   The height of adult humans almost always starts with a 1 or 2 when measured in meters
   It almost always starts with 4, 5, 6, or 7 when measured in feet.
   
   Telephone directories violate Benford's law because the numbers have a mostly fixed length
