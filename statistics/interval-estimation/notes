Interval estimation is the use of sample data to calculate an interval of plausible values of an unknown population parameter; 

Interval estimation can be contrasted with point estimation, which gives a single value.

Forms of interval estimation are:
  - confidence intervals (a frequentist method)
  - credible intervals (a Bayesian method)
  - tolerance intervals (an estimate of a population); and
  - prediction intervals (an estimate of a future observation, used mainly in regression analysis).
