Statistics include numerical facts and figures (largest eaarthquake etc.).
The study of statistics involves math and relies upon calculations of numbers.

A basic division of statistics is:
  Descriptive statistics vs infernential statistics.
     descriptiv:
        summarize and describe data.
          - mean, min, max, count(*)
     inferential:
        draw inferences about POPOLATION from a smaller SAMPLE.
        
Random sampling vs random assignment.
  Random assignment:
     Division of the sample into two groups (experimental and control group).
     - critical for the validity of an experiment.
     - failure to assign subjects randomly to groups is generally more serious than having a non-random sample:
         it invalidates the experimental findings
         However, failure to randomize entire sample only restricts the generability of the results.
         
Biased sample:
  - will likely have groups from the population over-represented or under-represented due to systematic sampling factors.
