In a SUPERVISED learning model, the algorithm learns on a LABELED dataset.

An UNSUPERVISED model, in contrast, provides UNLABELED data that the algorithm
tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.

In REINFORCEMENT learning trains an algorithm with a REWARD system, providing
feedback when an artificial intelligence agent performs the best action in a particular situation.
