  is measured by the *variance*
  Another meausre of dispersion is the *standard variation*
  The third measure of dispersion is *skewness*
  The fourth measure of dispersion is *kurtosis* (a measure of the "fatness" of the tails of a pmf or pdf.)

In mathematics, computer science and operations research, mathematical optimization or mathematical programming, alternatively spelled optimisation, is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.[1]

Exploratory and confirmatory data analysis

Numerical methods
  - Finite difference method – used to solve partial differential equations;
  - Monte Carlo method – Also used to solve partial differential equations, but Monte Carlo simulation is also common in risk management;
  - Ordinary least squares – used to estimate parameters in statistical regression analysis;
  - Spline interpolation – used to interpolate values from spot and forward interest rates curves, and volatility smiles;
  - Bisection, Newton, and Secant methods – used to find the roots, maxima and minima of functions (e.g. internal rate of return.)

CV:

  Developers are called Quants

  - culling through vast amount of data.
  - validata patterns
  - first: quantiative analysis -> formulate strategy
  - number crunching
  - making rational, fact based decisions.
  - create model, then develop computer program that applies model to historic (market) data
    Backtest model
    -> Then implement system in realtime markets.
  - discover counterintuitive patterns
  - Exploit predictive patterns in historical data
  - calculate the optimal probability of executing a profitable trade
  - Overcome emotions such as fear or greed which stifle rational thinking
  - A Quant specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods
  - C++, VBA
  - Stress Test
  - bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.
  - statistics and probability, calculus centered around partial differential equations, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and econometrics. 
  - collect data -> clean data -> exploratory data analysis -> models and algorithms -> communicate/visualize/reports -> make decision
  - anomaly detection
  - data dredging, data fishing, data snooping, data archaeology
  - data preparation (TODO: might compromise confidentially and privacy) -> modeling -> evaluation -> result validation -> deployment
  - regression, summarization, clustering, classification
  - Trying to find relationships between variables.
  - computer (Monte-carlo) simulations
  - stochastic programming
